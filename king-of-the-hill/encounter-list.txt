ENCOUNTER LIST

1. PROLOGUE-1: Getting onto the ships.
2. PROLOGUE-2: On the ship.

3. SHIP-1: Attack in moonlight.
    On a successful repulse, go to encounter VILLAGE-1.
4. SHIP-2: Docking at the village.
    If the PCs take over and try to flee in the boat, 
        go to encounter SHIP-3.
    Depending on how much fighting you'd like to do, 
        more fighting: go to encounter VILLAGE-1.
        some social challenges: go to encounter VILLAGE-4.
5. SHIP-3: The naval trap.
    In this encounter, this ship *is* stopped, even if that requires
    the ship to be holed and sunk. Note that unless the ship stops at
    the village, it will go to this encounter anyway, and the PCs may
    later encounter this ship along with the dead captain/crew.

6. VILLAGE-1: A village captured.
    The village is repressed, and the terrorisers - the bugbears -
    immediately show up with their minions. The PCs have to fight
    them.
        If they instead escape to the boat, go to encounter SHIP-3.
        PCs should NOT lose this encounter. The DM could have the
        villagers join in - either a spontaneous "revolt" or an
        attack by a well-trained militia in hiding, depending on
        how much help the PCs need.

7. VILLAGE-2: A village alone.
    The village is now free, but the King will soon send his minions 
    to recapture the victim. They must decide whether to barricade
    the village or try to infiltrate the hill.


X. HALFLING-1: Hide or strike.
    The PCs are captured by the halflings. A major and influential
    group of halflings is in charge, and immediately send word to
    the King. Before the response returns - which might mean their
    death - the PCs should plan their next move: to attack the
    halflings and make a break for it, to try to win the halflings
    onto their sides, or to go along with being captured for now
    and see where it gets them (i.e. take an Extended Rest).
        If PCs convince the moderate halflings to restore equamity,
        we move to HALFLING-2. Otherwise, we'll probably end up
        at DOCK-1.
X. HALFLING-2: Freedom!
    The moderate halflings and the PCs attack the King's Halflings.
        If this encounter becomes too simple, the "response" might
        return from the King -- sent by a few bugbears.
